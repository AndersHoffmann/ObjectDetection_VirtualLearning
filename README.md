# Object Detection -  Virtual Learning Research Project
Detect specific parts of specific assembly - to be used in external PhD research studies regarding learning ability in virtual reality. 

Build upon request from PhD researchers at Aarhus University. Current version is inadequate due to inaccuracies in predictions, which is caused by lack of proper data. However, it still manages to demonstrate the process of creating a fully functional version, and the technologies which can be utilized to get there.
